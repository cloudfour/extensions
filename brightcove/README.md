#### How to use this extension
We have created a step-by-step guide on how to create a Brightcove extension for your content types. You can refer the [Brightcove extension guide](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/guide/extensions/brightcove-extension-setup-guide) on our documentation site for more info.


#### Required Config Parameters
You will need to add the following config parameters for the extension:

```
{
	"client_id": "YOUR_BRIGHTCOVE_CLIENT_ID",
	"client_secret": "YOUR_BRIGHTCOVE_CLIENT_SECRET",
	"oauthUrl": "YOUR_BRIGHTCOVE_AUTH_PROXY_URL",
	"brightcoveUrl": "https://cms.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/4709052668001/videos",
	"searchUrl": "https://cms.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/4709052668001/videos?q="
}
```

You'll need to set up a proxy for the [Brightcove oAuth API](https://support.brightcove.com/overview-oauth-api-v4) to get a token. You can find an [example here](https://github.com/BrightcoveLearning/sample-proxy-apps). Your proxy should return the token object, which can then be passed to the standard Brightcove API endpoints shown above.
